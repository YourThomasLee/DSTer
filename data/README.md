# Dialogue state tracking data collection and preprocess

## 1. The objective of file in this directory

The process of  existing method to get model's input from original data is so different that researchers have to pay so much attention to the pre-process details. The objective of files in this directory is try to provide an unified way to fetch and use dialogue data.

This directory stores the public datasets used to evaluate the models in tracking dialogue states which represents the dialogue state of user in utterance for specific target like booking restaurant, searching for attraction area, and looking for a great movie. 

## 2. Access provided to datasets

Here I listed public datasets that are designed for dialogue state tracking evaluation

-  [DSTC2 & DSTC3](https://github.com/matthen/dstc): 
- [Sim-M, Sim-R, Sim-Gen](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/simulated-dialogue):
- [MultiWOZ 1.0 & 2.0 & 2.1 & 2.2](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz/tree/master) & [2.3](https://github.com/lexmen318/MultiWOZ-coref) & [2.4](https://github.com/smartyfh/MultiWOZ2.4): 
- [SGD](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogue):
- [CrossWOZ](https://github.com/thu-coai/CrossWOZ):
- [RiSAWOZ](https://github.com/terryqj0107/RiSAWOZ)ï¼š

Actually there are already some excellent data loader to datasets above. As a result, I choose to use the existing version of data loader of huggingface. For those datasets which was not yes supported by hugging face, I plan to provide the supplement codes at my leisure time. I will post it after I commit it

data loader for MultiWOZ:  

- [multi-woz2.2 loader](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_woz_v22)
- [multiwoz_dst](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adamlin/multiwoz_dst)
- [multiwoz_all_versions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pietrolesci/multiwoz_all_versions/tree/main)

Leader board: [multi-woz 2.0](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-domain-dialogue-state-tracking-on); [multi-woz 2.1](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-domain-dialogue-state-tracking-on-1); [multi-woz 2.2](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-domain-dialogue-state-tracking-on-2)



file description:

- `prepare_env.sh`: fetch datasets from network space (you should make sure that your configuration of git account is correct, because this script depends it) 

- `dialogue_data.py`: this python script provides a common interface to get the data in the same way, so that you can use different versions/types of dataset like:
  
  ```python
  from data import dialogue_data
  name = "MultiWOZ"
  version = "2.0"
  data = dialogue_data(name, version)
  ```





schema design(TODO):

class dialogue_data

| attributes | types | description |
