Through the application of correlation data analysis, PID control algorithms, and Kalman filtering, I was able to select optimal dynamic data windows and improve state estimation accuracy to enhance system performance. Additionally, I designed an algorithm for automatic and quick tuning of PID algorithm parameters based on statistical insights, providing a solution that uses machine learning to streamline the optimization process. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also equipped me with the tools to take on complex problems and contribute to the team in meaningful ways.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nReference:\\\n\\\n[Course: COMP 150 - 03 BDL: Bayesian Deep Learning](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150BDL/2019f/)\\\n\\\n[blog: Deep learning is not good enough, we need bayesian deep learning for safe AI](https://alexgkendall.com/computer_vision/bayesian_deep_learning_for_safe_ai/)\\\n\\\n[blog: Bayesian theorem: a framework for critical thinking](https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html)\\\n\\\n[blog: 西山晴雪的博客](https://xishansnow.github.io/)\\\n\\\n[blog: A comprehensive introduction to bayesian deep learning](https://jorisbaan.nl/2021/03/02/introduction-to-bayesian-deep-learning.html)\\\n\\\n[Survey: a updating survey for bayesian deep learning](https://github.com/js05212/BayesianDeepLearning-Survey/blob/master/README.md)\\\n\\\n深度学习\\\n\\\n课程主页： https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n\\\n\\\nB站（2021秋）课程：[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18Y411p79k?spm\\\\_id\\\\_from=333.337.search-card.all.click](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18Y411p79k?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)\\\n\\\n学习方法： 背景 \\\\+ 表示 \\\\+ 评价 \\\\+ 优化\\\n\\\n这门课程主要会多些应用，因此考虑先学习以下课程之后再去看这门课程\\\n\\\nCMU 11-785 Introduction to deep learning (http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F22/index.html)\\\n\\\n课程主页： http://introtodeeplearning.com\\\n\\\nB站视频（2018-2021）： [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g34y1Q79p?spm\\\\_id\\\\_from=333.337.search-card.all.click](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g34y1Q79p?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)\\\n\\\n值得学习的公开课：https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses\\\n\\\n贝叶斯统计: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iV411v7Yw?spm\\\\_id\\\\_from=333.999.0.0](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iV411v7Yw?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)\\\n\\\n线性代数的本质: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ys411472E?spm\\\\_id\\\\_from=333.999.0.0](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ys411472E?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)\\\n\\\n几何深度学习: https://geometricdeeplearning.com/lectures/\\\n\\\nMath for deep learning：https://github.com/rkneusel9/MathForDeepLearning\\\n\\\ndeep learning tuning playbook: https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook\\\n\\\nproject template: https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template\\\n\\\nhyperparameters optimization: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3092}]"
