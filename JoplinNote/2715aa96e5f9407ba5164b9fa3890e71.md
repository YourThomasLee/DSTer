Geometric hashing is a computer vision technique used to detect geometric features in images and matching them to a database with such features. What makes geometric hashing stand out is that it can detect overlapping objects, objects that have gone transformation, or when only partial information is present.

# Working process
Geometric hashing works by getting discrete points on 2D or 3D objects and use those points to match models stored in a hash table. When an image or geometric contour is coming, we construct a query into hash table and get the result.

In an image where ther are partially blocked objects, its interest points are extracted and based on those points we overlap two structures to find its coincidence points. 
There are two stages (1) preprocessing and (2) recognition. We can see the general scheme of the algorithm below
-  In the pre-processing stage, target points or its geometric features will be extracted in each structure and will be stored in a hash table. 
-  the process goes as follows:
	- Extract point features of the model. each dot represents a feature’s location or a list of one or more attributes.
	- Determine the minimal number of features as its basis or find an ordered pair of points as reference .
This allows expression of the other features and reference that remains unchanged when the model undergoes rotation, translation, or scaling.
	- There will be a tuple of the different basis points of the model. This is because it is not guaranteed that our basis points will still be present if there’s partial occlusion. Thus we make different entries per model in the hash table.
	- Use the reference points/basis as an address to the hash table and store the object info in that space.

Then for the Recognition stage, the features of the input is to be detected, extracted, and mapped to different entries in the hash table until it finds a match. the process goes as follows:
- points of interest in the input image is extracted.
- a pair or basis of interest points will be determined
- Using the interest points or basis points. use this to check appropriate entrance in the hash table and vote for the pairs (the model, and your basis/interest points) appearing.
- when a certain pair scored high then it can be the match between the object in the input image and the model from the hash table.

**Complexity**: Let 
- M be the number of known models in database
- S be the number of features of each scene during recognition
- C be the number of features needed to form a basis
- H complexity of accesing hash table bin, this dependes on the hash table size an bin distribution

Worst case time complexity:
