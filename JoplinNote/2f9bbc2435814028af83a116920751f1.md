Research Proposal

What does a good research proposal look like? In general, it should address the following questions:

* What is your research project about?
* Why is the project relevant for your field of research?
* How should the research be conducted?
* What is the schedule for the project?

A well-structured research proposal answers these questions transparently and step-by-step. Typically, a proposal is between 3 and 10 pages long.
