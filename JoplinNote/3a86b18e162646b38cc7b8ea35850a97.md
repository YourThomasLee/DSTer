From: Baizhen Li 1833009@tongji.edu.cn
Subject: Prospective PhD Student Inquiry

Dear Professor Witold Pedrycz,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Li Baizhen and I am writing to express my interest in the PhD program at Alberta University starting in 2024, as well as to inquire about any potential opportunities to join your research group.

As I was searching potential programs and faculty members, I came across your impressive paper titled "Advancing Federated Learning with Granular Computing" on your Google Scholar page. Your innovative approach incorporating granular computing within federated learning specifically sparked my interest. Additionally, as someone who has been studying granular computing for several years, I am particularly intrigued by finding ways to apply rough sets to deep learning. In fact, I have developed a more efficient knowledge discovery algorithm based on rough sets, which you can access via this link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025520304436.

If you are currently recruiting PhD students for your lab, I would be honored to be considered for a position. Due to my background as a C++ software engineer and having recently completed a Master's degree at Tongji University in 2021, I am confident that my educational background and research experience make me an excellent candidate for your group. For your reference, I have attached my CV to this email. If there is any additional information that would be helpful for you to know, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards, Li Baizhen([1833009@tongji.edu.cn](mailto:1833009@tongji.edu.cn))
