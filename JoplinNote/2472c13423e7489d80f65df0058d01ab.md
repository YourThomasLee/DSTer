0 - How to write a good letter to have first conversation with professor

[Advice for Prospective Research Students](https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/)

如果你不认识这种引荐人，可以给导师写邮件，内容包括：

> - 现任导师。
> - 用一句话介绍你过去的工作（例如，在哪里发表过研究工作？）。
> - 你和导师可以合作的潜在研究的四个要点，最好以「要点：一句话解释要点」的形式进行陈述。

如果没有私人联系，你的潜在导师基本不可能查看或者回复你的邮件。如果没有私人联系且申请欧洲（英国）的大学，那么你就可以考虑申请其他地方了。

# The purpose of first letter and something you should never do

Your goal in sending email is not to contact as many professors as you can, but to identify a few professors who you might want as your research advisor and then to find which of those seem most promising as advisors and convince them that you would be a worthwhile student.

Before contacting a potential advisor, do your homework: read the advisor’s home page and at least one recent paper. If doing this doesn’t give you any interesting ideas, this is probably not someone with whom you want to do research so you shouldn’t waste time contacting her or him. If it does, send a short introductory email.

the list of things that professors suggest you should never do:

- Don't send information about your GRE scores, GPA, class rank, cholesterol levels, favorite movies, etc. and ask what your chances of admission are. Standardized tests and grades have minimal influence on your chances of admission and reveal very little about your potential as a researcher. No one can or should tell you anything about your chances of admission based on an email (other than that you are more likely to be rejected now since you sent an annoying email).
- Don't send a first email **longer than a typical screenful**. You should be able to get across everything you need in a first email concisely and use longer emails if technical depth is required in follow ups.
- Don't waste space and time telling me how hard-working, creative and smart you are — demonstrate it with the contents of your message.
- Don't waste space and time telling me how brilliant I am. The fact that you are interested in joining my research group is flattery enough.
- Don't make generic statements about being interested in my work or how well it relates to your interests. Most professors have projects in several different areas and can't figure out what you mean unless you describe a specific connection or interest.
- **Don't attach anything** to your email. If you want to provide additional content, you should do this by sending a URL (as plain text, not a link). It is useful to have a personal website that is fairly professional, and that conveys something about your experience and research interests. Its great if you have a blog post or two about something interesting you've learned or done. If you are applying to CS graduate programs, your personal website shouldn't be a LinkedIn page or some other site where you do not have full control over the content. There are lots of good free hosting sites (I often use github pages, but there are plenty of other good options). If you are not able to create a web page, you probably shouldn't be applying to CS graduate programs.
- Be aware that most email is filtered out by spam filters these days and never reaches the intended recipient. If you are a non-native English speaker sending email to someone at an English-speaking instutition, make sure your "From:" **address appears using the English alphabet**. Using characters that are not standard English in your email increases the risk that it will be filtered out as spam. I do realize it is very unfair for us to expect you to change your name for our convenience and cultural ignorance! But, once you get admitted you can and should tell people what you want them to call you. (Note that for your formal application it may be necessary to use a Westernized version of your name to comply with the application form, so if you use another name in your email communications with faculty, it is important to also provide the name you use in your application so they can identify the corresponding application. This is a good opportunity to refresh the relationship after you send in your application by informing your contact to the formal name used in your application.)
- Don't use any fancy **formatting** in your email (including your message signature).

## first example:

From: Flipper Wordsfish [flipper@adou.edu](mailto:flipper@adou.edu)
Subject: Student Interested in TSU Problem Make sure your from address and subject lines are useful
Dear Professor Nemo, Greeting: its safest to be a bit formal here.
I will be finishing a BS degree in Underwater Mathematics at the Atlantis Deep Ocean University this year. I am considering applying to UVA's PhD program and would be interested joining your Octople Cryptology research group.

Briefly introduce yourself in at most two sentences. Don’t tell your whole life story. Be direct and clear about applying to grad school.

I found your paper, "A Linear-Time Solution to the Travelling Sea Urchin Problem", on your website (http://www.smith.org/urchin.html). I was fascinated by your result, especially as I have spent several summers studying the similar travelling sea cucumber problem as an intern at Microshifty Corp in the Attle Sea. You can find a paper about my work on this at http://www.flipper.com/research/tscp.html.
Explain specifically what you read and where you found it (people sometimes publish several papers with similar names and forget which is which). A touch of flattery never hurts, but don’t go overboard. If appropriate, relate it to your background and interests and briefly plug your work.

I believe your result is even more important than your paper implies, since it can be extended to solve the Travelling Salescritter Problem and thus to prove P = NP. Concisely describe your insight or why you are interested in the work.
Do you think it would be worthwhile to pursue this line of research? If you are interested, I can send you a proof sketch.

End with a clear, simple question.
Offer a suggestion on how to proceed.
Regards,
Flipper Wordsfish (flipper@adou.edu)

Dear Recruiting Manager,

I am writing to apply for the 2019 Bridge to BCG workshop. I recently learned about this program when I attended the presentation by Dr. Panier at the reception for Advanced Degree Candidates at BCG’s Boston office. I expect to complete my Ph.D. in Cellular Biology at Harvard University in May 2019 and look forward to the chance to get an insider’s view of consulting at BCG this summer. Based on my analytical skills, communication ability, and problem-solving mindset, I think I would be a great fit for this workshop.

My intellectual curiosity and passion for asking questions is what led me to pursue my Ph.D. in Cellular Biology; however, my interest in a business career is also long-standing. At UMass, Amherst, I combined my interests by pursuing a chemistry and economics double major and enjoyed gaining the quantitative and analytical skills. A Global Strategies course gave me a taste of the real-life challenges faced by companies, such as decisions Novo Industri of Denmark had to make in response to the technology developments for insulin purification in the 1980s. On the other hand, a bioinformatics course introduced me to the challenges biologists encounter in producing and analyzing large scale biological data. Throughout my Ph.D. education, in addition to improving my research and analytical skills, I kept up my interest in the business of science. I participated in a workshop on Healthcare Innovation and Commercialization to explore how science is applied in the business world. I collaborated with five of the workshop participants to prepare a venture capital pitch to commercialize a real-life innovation in anesthesia for child-birth. Our “VC pitch” was selected, by a panel of five expert judges, as the best among four presentations.

My passion for teaching has provided me with a unique skill set that I believe will be critical for a successful career in consulting. My communication skills strengthened as I challenged myself to understand and respond to students’ questions while they tackled complex biological concepts. To convey material clearly to students with diverse learning styles, I developed different approaches to explain a single concept. I also embraced and supported a team culture, utilizing student feedback to improve my own performance and encouraging students to engage each other in their learning.

The analytical and communication skills I have honed throughout my PhD work will provide a strong foundation as I transition from the life sciences to a career in consulting. I am specifically interested in BCG due to its unique approach to personal growth and tailored solutions for each client. A commitment to support and train ADC members and global opportunities offered through BCG are invaluable. I look forward to hearing back from you about the opportunity to participate in the 2019 Bridge to BCG workshop and to learn even more about BCG. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, Abi Demir

Based on chats with faculty, I would rank the personal statement as the third most important part of your application, behind (1) [great] published results and (2) letters of recommendation.

The statement of purpose should describe succinctly your reasons for applying to the proposed program at Stanford, your preparation for this field of study, study and research interests, future career plans, and other aspects of your background and interests which may aid the admissions committee in evaluating your aptitude and motivation for graduate study.

Looking back at the prompt, there are 5 things that you want to talk about:

(1) What are your reasons for applying to the proposed program at XX?
(2) What is your preparation for this field of study?
(3) What are your research interests?
(4) What are your future career plans?
(5) What other aspects of your background are relevant to the admissions committee?
I addressed these bullet points in my essays in the following order: (3), (2), (1), and sprinkled (4) throughout.

cover letter的形式一般包括 **自我介绍** （通常在第一段，1-2句话，占2-4行）、 **科研经历陈述** （第二三段，是重点）、 **表明自己的兴趣/为什么自己是right candidate** （最后一段）。关于职位的见解不需要太多 。cover letter要花多点时间斟酌优化，注意长度控制在1-2页，1页最好。我是全部控制在1页，有些内容多一些的，就通过调整行距（1.5-1.3-1.2这样）来控制页数。
cover letter写好了可以一直使用的，每次投出去之前稍作修改就行。有些职位是在线申请的，cover letter就以文件形式传上去。有些职位是发邮件申请的，cover letter可以复制到邮件里，或者直接传到附件都行。
