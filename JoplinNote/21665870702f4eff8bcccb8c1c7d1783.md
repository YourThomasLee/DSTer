1. Concepts

In this part, I firstly introduce the logical concepts, i.e., geometry concepts in the Boost.Geometry library. Next, I dive into the concrete implementations of these concepts, i.e. concrete class of Boost.Geometry library. Finally, I try to understand some classical geometry algorithms in the reading the codes in Boost.Geometry.

## Geometry concepts

| geometry type | dimension | description | example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Point | 0-dimensional | A point is *an entity that has a location in space or on a plane, but has no extent* | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_point.html) |
| MultiPoint | 0-dimensional | multi_point, a collection of points | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_multi_point.html) |
| Segment | 1-dimensional | In geometry, a line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points, and contains every point on the line between its end points. | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_segment.html) |
| linestring | 1-dimensional | A linestring is *a Curve with linear interpolation between Points*. ([OGC Simple Feature Specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)). | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_linestring.html) |
| multi_linestring | 1-dimensional | multi_line, a collection of linestring | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_multi_linestring.html) |
| box | 2-dimensional | A box is a geometry with (usually) two or three dimensions, having its axis aligned to the coordinate system.<br>The box is not one of the basic types in Boost.Geometry (point, linestring, polygon) but it is a *helper type*. The main reasons for the box existance are its usefulness for indexing (a spatial index, or splitting a geometry into monotonic sections) and it is the output of the [envelope](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/algorithms/envelope.html "envelope") algorithm. Therefore, a box is axis aligned (the envelope is also called aabb, axis aligned bounding box).<br>The segment concept is similar to the box concept, defining using another tag. However, the box concept assumes the index as `min_corner`, `max_corner`, while for the segment concept, there is no assumption. | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_box.html) |
| ring | 2-dimensional | A ring (aka linear ring) is a closed line which should not be selfintersecting. | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_ring.html) |
| polygon | 2-dimensional | A polygon is *A polygon is a planar surface defined by one exterior boundary and zero or more interior boundaries* ([OGC Simple Feature Specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)). | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_polygon.html) |
| multi-polygon | 2-dimensional | multi_polygon, a collection of polygons | [link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_multi_polygon.html) |
