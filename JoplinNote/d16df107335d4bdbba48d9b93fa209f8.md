## 0.1 preliminary material

During summer school, we will discuss quite advanced topics of Bayesian Deep Learning.
The school lasts only 6 days, and we do not have enough time for a detailed introduction into
basic Bayesian Methods and Deep Learning. That's why we expect you to come with the
knowledge of some basic concepts.
Below we present a checklist of concepts which you have to be familiar with before the
summer school. We also provide links to the materials on these topics. We recommend
studying the materials on concepts you are not familiar with. Otherwise, it will be hard for
you to follow the school lectures.
Although there are a few intro lectures on Bayesian approach in the program, they are not
enough to understand the specifics of this approach if it is your first acquaintance. But they
will be helpful to understand the connections between methods if you studied the materials
in advance.

Checklist:

- Bayesian methods
    
    - Concepts:
        
        1.  Bayesian reasoning v. s. frequentist reasoning
        2.  Conjugate priors and analytical Bayesian inference
        3.  EM-algorithm
        4.  Variational inference, mean-field approximation, and conditional conjugacy
    - Materials:
        
        1.  First 3 weeks of [Bayesian methods for machine learning](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/cse515t/fall_2019/)
        2.  Or, if you prefer reading books, chapters 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 in [PatternRecognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) by Christopher Bishop(\[英文版\](C:\\Users\\Brick\\Desktop\\MyStudy\\Bayesian deep learning\\deepbayes-2019\\reference\\Bishop - Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning - Springer 2006.pdf), \[中文版\](C:\\Users\\Brick\\Desktop\\MyStudy\\Bayesian deep learning\\deepbayes-2019\\reference\\PRML_chinese.pdf))
        3.  To test your knowledge, try solving Bayesian methods problems in \[homework.pdf\](C:\\Users\\Brick\\Desktop\\MyStudy\\Bayesian deep learning\\deepbayes-2019\\homework.pdf)
- deep learning
    
    - Concepts:
        
        1.  Computational graphs, deep understanding of backpropagation,
            stochastic gradient descent
        2.  Fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent neural networks, their
            popular architectures (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, LSTM)
        3.  Regularization in deep learning: weight decay, dropout, batch
            normalization
        4.  Generative adversarial networks
    - Materials:
        
        1.  Lectures 3-11 of Stanford's [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks<br>for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (see [Syllabus with materials](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) and [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv))
        2.  Or, if you prefer reading books, Chapters 6-10 and 20.10.4 of [Deep<br>Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)(花书看实体书即可)
        3.  Or first 4 videos from [Introduction to Deep Learning by MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com/index.html)
    - To test your knowledge, try solving Deep learning problems in this document \[homework.pdf\](C:\\Users\\Brick\\Desktop\\MyStudy\\Bayesian deep learning\\deepbayes-2019\\homework.pdf)
        
- Pytorch
    
    - Concepts:
        
        1.  Tensors, autograd and implementing custom algorithms using basic
            operations
        2.  nn.Module and how it helps to implement any computational graph
        3.  Constructing and training neural networks
    - Materials:
        
        1.  Parts of an official PyTorch tutorial: [Quick 60-min intro](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) , [Learning<br>PyTorch with examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html) , [What is torch.nn really](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html)?
        2.  Or, if you prefer tutorials in Jupiter notebooks where you write missing code, we suggest solving Part Q5 (PyTorch version) of [Stanford's assignment](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment2/) .
        3.  To test your knowledge, try implementing Multi-layer perceptron on [Boston dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) yourself in low-level PyTorch using nn.Module, basic mathematical operations (like matrix multiplication or random tensor initialization) and autograd.

We also recommend taking a look at a [Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) . It is a good collection of useful mathematical facts that will be useful at the summer school. You should understand basic concepts from this book (basic operations with matrices, matrix derivatives, properties of distributions etc).
