Through the application of correlation data analysis, PID control algorithms, and Kalman filtering, I was able to select optimal dynamic data windows and improve state estimation accuracy to enhance system performance. Additionally, I designed an algorithm for automatic and quick tuning of PID algorithm parameters based on statistical insights, providing a solution that uses machine learning to streamline the optimization process. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also equipped me with the tools to take on complex problems and contribute to the team in meaningful ways.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\"],[0,\"## Educa\"]],\"start1\":223,\"start2\":223,\"length1\":16,\"length2\":956}]"
