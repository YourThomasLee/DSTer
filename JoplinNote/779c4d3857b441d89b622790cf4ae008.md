note-22-beyond the granularity: multi-perspective dialogue collaborative selection for dialogue state tracking

## outline


## details
The architecture of model can be depicted as following:
![3a37c35f49b11a506dcc16b9e76c919b.png](:/8d80e9fb8071442b857f80293c1fe4e9)
there are three parts for modeling different perspectives consideration.

- (dialogue history, slot name): devise an SN-DH module to touch on the relation of the dialogue history and the slot name, which directly reflects the relevance.
- (dialogue history, current turn): propose a CT-DH module to explore the dependency between each turn in the dialogue history and current turn dialogue
- (current_turn, coreferences): propose an Implicit Mention Oriented Reasoning module to tackle the implicit mention(coreferences) problems that commonly exists in complex dialogues.

Information encoding process: the authors employ the representation of the previous turn dialogue state $B_{T-1}$ concatenated to the representation of each turn dialogue utterances $D_t$ as input:
$$
E_t = [CLS]_t \oplus B_{T-1}\oplus [SEP]\oplus D_t(1\leq t \leq T)
$$
where $[CLS]_t$ is a special token added in front of every turn input. The representation of the previous turn dialogue state is $B_{T-1} = B_{T-1}^1\oplus \cdots \oplus B_{T-1}^J$. The representation of each slot's state $B_{T-1}^j = [SLOT]_{T-1}^j\oplus S_j\oplus [VALUE]_{T-1}^j \oplus V_{T-1}^j$, where $[SLOT]_{T-1}^j$ and $[VALUE]_{T-1}^j$ are special tokens that represent the slot name and the slot value at turn $T-1$. The representation of the dialogue at turn $t$ as $D_t = R_t\oplus;\oplus U_t [SEP]$, where $R_t$ is the system response and $U_t$ is the user utterance. Here ";" is a special token used to mark the boundary between $R_t$ and $U_t$, and $[SEP]$ is a special token used to mark the end of a dialogue turn.
