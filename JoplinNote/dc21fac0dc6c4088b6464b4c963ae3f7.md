## Experiences

I. Research experiences

- From 08/2019 to 12/2020, I participated in "Research on the Refined Description and Interpretability of Targets under Surveillance Video"(National natural science foundation of China, No. 61976160). I was in charge of models that provide task-oriented descriptions of a picture collected from surveillance video while working as a researcher under the direction of professor Zhihua Wei and associate professor Lijun Sun.
- From 06/2018 to 07/2019, I took part in "Topic Analysis Technology based on Natural Language Processing” (application research cooperated with the key lab of information network security, China ministry of public security, No. C18608). I created topic analysis-based detection techniques for illicit website detection while working as a researcher and developer under the direction of professor Zhihua Wei and associate professor Lijun Sun.
- From 03/2014 to 06/2017, I participated in "Knowledge Space Research based on Granular Computing Method" (national natural science foundation of China youth science fund project, No. 61403329). I created two more effective rough sets-based knowledge discovery algorithms as a research assistant under the direction of associate professor Nan Zhang.

II. Work/Internship experiences

- **DONGFANG JINGYUAN ELECTRON LIMITED** 03/2023 – present
    I mainly contributed to the product strategy of sub-resolution assistant feature in optical proximity correction based on machine learning methods
    
- **BAIDU CHINA CO., LTD.** 03/2021 – 05/2022
    As an engineer, I was in charge of the real-time bidding system's cost-per-thousand-impression calibration(CTIA) module. By tweaking the algorithm's parameters and state estimates, I improved the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm's performance in CTIA.
