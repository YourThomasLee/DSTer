I am considering applying to UVA's PhD program and would be interested joining your Octople Cryptology research group.\\\n\\\nBriefly introduce yourself in at most two sentences. Don’t tell your whole life story. Be direct and clear about applying to grad school.\\\n\\\nI found your paper, \\\"A Linear-Time Solution to the Travelling Sea Urchin Problem\\\", on your website (http://www.smith.org/urchin.html). I was fascinated by your result, especially as I have spent several summers studying the similar travelling sea cucumber problem as an intern at Microshifty Corp in the Attle Sea. You can find a paper about my work on this at http://www.flipper.com/research/tscp.html.\\\nExplain specifically what you read and where you found it (people sometimes publish several papers with similar names and forget which is which). A touch of flattery never hurts, but don’t go overboard. If appropriate, relate it to your background and interests and briefly plug your work.\\\n\\\nI believe your result is even more important than your paper implies, since it can be extended to solve the Travelling Salescritter Problem and thus to prove P = NP. Concisely describe your insight or why you are interested in the work.\\\nDo you think it would be worthwhile to pursue this line of research? If you are interested, I can send you a proof sketch.\\\n\\\nEnd with a clear, simple question.\\\nOffer a suggestion on how to proceed.\\\nRegards,\\\nFlipper Wordsfish (flipper@adou.edu)\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1689}]"
