GPA: 87/100\\\n    **Thesis**: Research on dialogue state tracking algorithm based on cross-layer fusion\\\n    **Awards and honors**: National Scholarship(2020), Second Prize of the 15th China Post-graduate Mathematical Contest in Modelling, Outstanding Dissertation Award\\\n    \\\n2.  **YANTAI UNIVERSITY** 06/2013 - 07/2017\\\n    \\\n    ***B.E.***, Computer Science and Technology. GPA: 79/100\\\n    **Thesis:** Research on knowledge acquisition algorithms: a discernibility matrix approach\\\n    **Awards and honors:** Outstanding Dissertation Award, Third Prize of LAN QIAO International Collegiate Programming Contest\\\n    \\\n\\\n## Experiences\\\n\\\nI. Research experiences\\\n\\\n- From 08/2019 to 12/2020, I participated in \\\"Research on the Refined Description and Interpretability of Targets under Surveillance Video\\\"(National natural science foundation of China, No. 61976160). I was in charge of models that provide task-oriented descriptions of a picture collected from surveillance video while working as a researcher under the direction of professor Zhihua Wei and associate professor Lijun Sun.\\\n- From 06/2018 to 07/2019, I took part in \\\"Topic Analysis Technology based on Natural Language Processing” (application research cooperated with the key lab of information network security, China ministry of public security, No. C18608). I created topic analysis-based detection techniques for illicit website detection while working as a researcher and developer under the direction of professor Zhihua Wei and associate professor Lijun Sun.\\\n- From 03/2014 to 06/2017, I participated in \\\"Knowledge Space Research based on Granular Computing Method\\\" (national natural science foundation of China youth science fund project, No. 61403329). I created two more effective rough sets-based knowledge discovery algorithms as a research assistant under the direction of associate professor Nan Zhang.\\\n\\\nII. Work/Internship experiences\\\n\\\n- **DONGFANG JINGYUAN ELECTRON LIMITED** 03/2023 – present\\\n    I mainly contributed to the product strategy of sub-resolution assistant feature in optical proximity correction based on machine learning methods\\\n    \\\n- **BAIDU CHINA CO., LTD.** 03/2021 – 05/2022\\\n    As an engineer, I was in charge of the real-time bidding system's cost-per-thousand-impression calibration(CTIA) module. By tweaking the algorithm's parameters and state estimates, I improved the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm's performance in CTIA.\\\n    \\\n\\\n## Publications\\\n\\\n\\\\[1\\\\] **Baizhen Li**, Yibin Zhan, Zhihua Wei, Shikun Huang, Lijun Sun: Improved non-autoregressive dialog state tracking model.
