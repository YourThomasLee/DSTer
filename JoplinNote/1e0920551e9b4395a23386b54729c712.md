While statistical parity is an important property, it may still lead to undesirable outcomes that are blatantly unfair to individuals, such as discriminating in employment while maintaining statistical parity among candidates interviewed by deliberately choosing unqualified members of the protected group to be interviewed in the expectation that they will fail\\\n- Individual fairness: individual fairness addresses this by ensuring that any two individuals who are similar with respect to a particular task should be classified similarly.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":898}]"
