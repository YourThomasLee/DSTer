Due to my background as a C++ software engineer and having recently completed a Master's degree at Tongji University in 2021, I am confident that my educational background and research experience make me an excellent candidate for your group. For your reference, I have attached my CV to this email. If there is any additional information that would be helpful for you to know, please do not hesitate to ask.\\\n\\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my application.
