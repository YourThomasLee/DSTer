Task 1: 

Paragraph 1- paraphrase question.  
Paragraph 2- overview.  
Paragraph 3- describe main feature in detail. In a line graph or bar chart question you will only be expected to write about 2 or 3 things.  
Paragraph 4- describe another main feature in detail.

From very small to very large, here are some examples:  
Minimal-slight-gradual-moderate-considerable-significant-substantial-enormous-dramatic.


When we are looking at **dynamic graphs** we should be looking out for:

* What does the data do from the start to the finish?
* Do they generally go up or down or do they fluctuate?
* Any significant difference from the general trend?
* Overall increase/decrease?
* Peaks/lows?

When we look at **static graphs** we should be looking for:

* What are the highest/lowest values?
* What are the most noticeable differences?
* Any similarities?
* Any significant exceptions?

Overall, there was a general decrease/trend.... However, the pattern differs ....

First point...

The diagram shows the levels of charitable donations of people living in Britain, separated by age, between 1990 and 2010.

Overall, there was a general decrease in the percentage of people who donated money over the two time periods. However, the pattern differs between the three age groups before 50 and the two age groups after the age of 50.

The highest decrease was in the 18-25 category, which saw a decrease of 10%, from 17% in 1990 to 7% in 2010. 42% of people in the 36-50 age group gave to charity in 1990, the highest on the chart, and this fell to 35% in 2010. There was also a significant decline in donations among 26-35 year olds, from 31% to 24%.

The exception to this general trend downwards was among the 51-65 year olds and over 65s. In 2010, the 51-65 year olds gave the highest percentage with nearly 40 percent and this rose from 35% in 1990. Finally, those over 65 displayed a slight percentage increase of 3 percent.
