use this statement to answer the following question in essay form: "Why should we, the admissions committee, believe that you, the applicant, have the potential do research in field  *X*?" and "What kind of research could you see yourself doing and why?"

A personal statement should not cover your childhood experience with science, computers or math.
A really good "personal" statement will talk about projects you've worked on, any publications that resulted and include citations to relevant research articles from the field.
You should treat the personal statement like a letter to the professor at the top of your preferences list, because there's a reasonable chance that's what it is.

In my experience, the most important character trait in research is not intelligence, but self-discipline.

In practice, there is a way to override them, but it probably requires a professor going to bat for you and getting the right bits flipped in the university bureaucracy.
